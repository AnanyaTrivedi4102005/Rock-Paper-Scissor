ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

You may have played rock paper scissors before. Maybe you’ve used it to decide who pays for dinner or gets the first player choice for a team.
If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players. 
Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). 
The rules are straightforward:
    Rock smashes scissors.
    Paper covers rock.
    Scissors cut paper.
Now that you have the rules down, you can start thinking about how they might translate to Python code.

To create and play rock paper scissors, I will be using the if and elif statements in Python. 
I will prepare this game to be played between two players. 
Player 1 will be the user, and player 2 will be the computer. 
Player one will manually select the rock paper or scissors, while player two will choose randomly. 
So I will also use the random module in Python to create this game.
